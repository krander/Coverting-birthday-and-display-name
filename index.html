        <h3>sftwear backstory</h3>
        <p>You have two friends who decided to start a business that they have named sftwear. Their business is an ecommerce site that let's their customers create eccectric t-shirts. Unfortunately, your friends don't know anything about web development. Fortunately for them, and unfortunately for you, they know you are taking IT 411 and ask for help building their web site and web presence. You foolishly agree for a 5% stake in their business.</p>
